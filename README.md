## Abstract
Trust sampling effectively balances between following the unconditional diffusion model and adhering to the loss guidance, enabling more flexible and accurate constrained generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on complex tasks, and in drastically different domains of images and 3D motion generation, showing significant improvements over existing methods in terms of generation quality.
